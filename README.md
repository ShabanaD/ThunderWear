## ThunderWear

Joseph - used a dragon board as a makeshift alarm clock that as it rings, sends an email to the user with a current weather message and suggested clothing for that weather.

Suhavi - sorted a clothing database by type using Indico API for image recognition and filtered based on fetched weather data.

Shabana - used Weather Network API to fetch qualitative weather data and temperature for a specific city in the world.
